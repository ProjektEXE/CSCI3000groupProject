    <title>Arda</title>
    <p>Are you growing weary of the endless mundanities of life? Is your madness only contained by the hope of something new? If so, escape your Hobbit-hole and experience the magesty and history of Arda.</p>

    <p>Now, to resolve any confusion: Yes, Hobbits <em>are</em> from Middle-Earth. But just as you are from a city, a nation, and a continent;
    Hobbits live in The Shire, in a region called Middle earth, on a planet known as Arda. Your journey will be difficult at times, but in seeing and learning what Arda has to offer, 
    you will see that "it's a good worth fighting for."  </p>
