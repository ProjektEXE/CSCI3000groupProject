        <h2>History</h2>

        <p>
            Arrakis, also known as Dune, is a harsh desert planet located in the Canopus star system. 
            First discovered in the distant future, Arrakis quickly became the most sought-after world in the known 
            universe due to its sole production of the spice melange, a powerful substance that grants extended 
            life and enhanced mental abilities. By the 10th millennium, the planet's vast deserts were under the control 
            of various powerful factions, including House Harkonnen and later House Atreides, who vied for control over 
            the spice trade. However, the planet's unforgiving environment, with scorching heat, massive sandstorms, and 
            deadly sandworms, made it a treacherous place for all but the most resilient. Arrakis is also home to 
            the Fremen, the indigenous people who have adapted to the harsh conditions and fiercely protect their way of life. 
            Visitors to Arrakis can experience its epic landscapes, from the endless sand dunes to the ancient caves of 
            the Fremen, but they must tread carefully, as the planet holds secrets both mystical and perilous.

        <h2>Culture</h2>

        <p>
            The Fremen, Arrakis' indigenous people, live in deep symbiosis with their harsh desert environment, guided by 
            their spiritual reverence for the Shai-Hulud, the giant sandworms that rule the planet's sands. Their culture 
            places great importance on water conservation, survival, and a profound connection to the planet's rhythms, with 
            an understanding that all life on Arrakis is intertwined. The Fremen’s way of life emphasizes resilience, honor, and a 
            sacred bond to the spice melange that sustains their people and holds the key to their future.
            <br><br>
            Community is central to Fremen life, with sietches—hidden underground settlements—serving as safe havens where 
            families and clans support one another in an unforgiving world. Their traditions are rich and ceremonial, from the sacred 
            rites of water sharing to the practice of riding sandworms, a symbol of their mastery over the desert. For visitors, experiencing 
            the Fremen’s customs offers a rare glimpse into a culture that survives and thrives in the harshest conditions, driven by a 
            deep respect for the land and a fierce loyalty to their people.
