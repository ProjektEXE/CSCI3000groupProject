        <h2>History</h2>

        <p>
            Pandora, also known as Eywa’eveng by the Na’vi, is a lush moon orbiting the gas giant Polyphemus
            in the Alpha Centauri A system. Discovered in the mid-21st century, Pandora captivated humanity
            with its vibrant ecosystems, extraordinary magnetic fields, and abundant resources. By the 
            22nd century, the RDA began colonizing and exploiting Pandora, drawn by unobtanium, a rare 
            superconducting mineral. Despite its allure, Pandora's atmosphere proved lethal to humans 
            without specialized breathing gear. The moon also became a battleground of ideologies, as the 
            Na’vi sought to protect their sacred land against human expansion. Visitors to Pandora can 
            experience the planet’s natural beauty before the conflict, with its bioluminescent forests 
            and awe-inspiring landscapes!
        </p>

        <h2>Culture</h2>

        <p>
            The Na'vi, Pandora's indigenous people, live in profound harmony with their environment, guided by 
            their spiritual connection to Eywa, the all-encompassing life force. Their culture emphasizes a 
            deep respect for nature, fostering a way of life that celebrates balance, interconnectedness, and 
            sustainability. Through rituals, storytelling, and music, the Na'vi express their gratitude to 
            Pandora's vibrant ecosystem, blending their traditions seamlessly with the bioluminescent beauty of
            their surroundings.
            <br><br>
            Community is at the heart of Na'vi life, with clans working together in mutual support and shared 
            purpose. Their traditions are rich with meaning, from the bonding with direhorses and banshees to 
            the ceremonial dances under the glowing Tree of Souls. For visitors, experiencing the Na'vi's 
            customs offers a rare glimpse into a culture that thrives through unity, reverence, and the 
            profound belief that all life is connected in the great web of Eywa.
