        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            Cybertron was once a peaceful and technologically advanced planet, enjoying a "Golden Age".
            It was home to the Cybertronian race, known for their sentient robotic nature. The planet
            thrived with plentiful resources and a harmonious society. That was until the rise of the
            Decepticons, a group of Cybertronians who sought power and control. This led to a
            devastating civil war between the Autobots and Decepticons, primarily over Energon, the
            planet's vital energy source. The long-lasting conflict caused significant damage to
            Cybertron's infrastructure and resources, eventually leaving the planet barren and
            inhospitable. But worry not, for we can transport you to a time before the disaster! </p>

        <h2>Culture</h2>
        <p>
            Cybertron's culture during its Golden Age was a beautiful combination of artistry, precision,
            and technological brilliance. It was a society where every structure and creation reflected
            both aesthetic beauty and engineering ingenuity. Festivals and celebrations illuminated their
            cities with dazzling light shows, synchronized to harmonious mechanical symphonies that
            resonated through the metallic streets. Art took on a uniquely Cybertronian form, blending
            intricate geometric patterns and shimmering alloys to create masterpieces that celebrated
            their mechanical nature. Social interactions were marked by a profound sense of community and
            purpose. Cybertronians thrived in specialized roles, each contributing to a thriving ecosystem
            of innovation and creativity. Their architecture, music, and cultural rituals reflected their
            harmonious balance with their environment, offering visitors a glimpse into a society where
            technology wasn't just a tool but a defining aspect of identity. Cybertron's culture truly
            embodied the ideal of progress through unity and creativity, leaving an indelible impression
            on all who experienced it. </p>
