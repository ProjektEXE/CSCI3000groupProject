      The halo array is a group of 7 rings (halos) each 10,000km in diameter except for one, which is 30,000km. They
      were first built by Master Builder Faber and the Wise-Hands-to-Forgeâ€™s guild as a safe place away from the Flood;
      a dangerous species of parasite that reproduce by consuming sentient lifeforms of sufficient biomass and cognitive
      ability. Now, they are used as research facilities dedicated to studying many different life forms.
      On the surface lies a thriving and diverse ecosystem including jungles and deserts. The weather is perfect as it
      is controlled artificially to ensure ideal conditions for life. No matter where you choose to go, the temperature
      will remain temperate and pleasant. Gentle showers refresh the air, cool breezes sweep over vast plains, and the
      occasional thunderstorm that rolls across the landscape in a non-destructive display.
      One of the most iconic sights of the Halo Array, the land extends into the sky, providing a breathtaking view.
      Depending on where you stand, you can even see mountains, rivers, and cities far above you. Since Halos are often
      positioned near astronomical features, visitors might witness meteor showers, eclipses and more.
